# Requirements Checking for Dynamic Bidirectional Reconfiguration
This is a program for requirements checking, guaranteed reachability checking, and paths finding of a dynamic bidirectional reconfiguration problem in the DES framework.


Required tools:
 1. cmake (See here: https://cmake.org/download/)
 2. c++11/14
 
To build the project:
 1. Go to 'build' directory
 2. Put 'test.ADS' and 'extra_friendly.txt' in the 'build' directory
 3. Run cmake ..
 4. Run make
 5. Run ./check 
 6. The result is saved in 'result.txt' in the 'build' directory
 
</br>
The 'test.ADS' is the reconfiguration plant generated by the software TCT. Can also be seen as a graph. (see the attached GIF) </br>
The 'extra_friendly.txt' is to specify the reconfiguration specification of users. </br>
</br>
In 'coreach.h/cpp':</br>
The function 'guaranteedReach' is to find all states that are guaranteed reachable w.r.t the target state specified in 'extra_friendly.txt'. </br>
The function 'efficientGR' is to find the states that are sufficient for proving the source state is guaranteed reachable w.r.t the target state. (Both the source state and the target state are specified in 'extra_friendly.txt')
